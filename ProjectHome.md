# The **rsa** project #

This is an implementation of the _RSA cryptography algorithm_.

The project is written in standard C++ from scratch. It currently supports RSA encryption and decryption of files or strings, and RSA key generation. The goal of this project is to make a portable, easy to understand and complete implementation of the RSA algorithm.

To check out the code using SVN, type:
```
svn checkout http://rsa.googlecode.com/svn/rsa/trunk rsa-read-only
```
